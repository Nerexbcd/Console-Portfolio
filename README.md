# Console Portfolio
This project was one of the first projects that I created, a long time ago, when I started exploring web development, JavaScript, and the creation of personal Portfolios.

> The code on this repository can have some errors or missunderstandings of how to use certain packages, functions, etc..; so I don't recommend using it as an example of code!

## Hosted Example
Currently the website is being hosted on GitHub Pages to show how it would look like, and maybe inspire other developers to try to make something similar.  
The website is hosted on [nerexbcd.github.io/Console-Portfolio](https://nerexbcd.github.io/Console-Portfolio/) if You want to check it out.
